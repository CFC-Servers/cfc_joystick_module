# cfc_joystick_module
~~Stolen~~ Borrowed from MattJeanes' project which ~~stole~~ borrowed from NightEagle's project


## Instructions:

### As a user:
---
Download [this file](https://github.com/MattJeanes/Joystick-Module/raw/master/lua/bin/gmcl_joystick_win32.dll) from the original project and put it in your `garrysmod/garrysmod/lua/bin/` folder (create that folder if it doesn't exist.)

**Please Note:** While many people use this exact file without problem, you need to know that you can't see what's inside of this file as it's compiled source code. This means it could be doing _anything_ behind the scenes and you wouldn't know it. Again, while this is very probably fine, you should still be aware of the risk.

**Still want to use this addon but don't trust the compiled code?** Luckily the source code for this `.dll` is also [provided in the original project](https://github.com/MattJeanes/Joystick-Module/tree/master/src). If you were highly motivated, you could learn how to compile C++ projects on your own machine and generate the `.dll` straight from the source code. This is much safer because you can read through all of the code before you compile it, meaning there are no nasty surprises.

Just install this addon, ya' dingus.
